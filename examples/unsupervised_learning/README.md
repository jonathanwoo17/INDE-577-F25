# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning refers to machine learning tasks where data does not come
with explicit labels or target values. The goal is to uncover structure in the
data, such as clusters or communities.

Given a dataset of inputs
x1, x2, ..., xn,
the model attempts to learn useful representations of the data by identifying similarities,
groupings, or underlying distributions, without explicit guidance from labeled examples.


## Types of Unsupervised Learning Problems

Unsupervised learning problems are commonly grouped into the following categories:

- **Clustering**: grouping similar data points together based on distance or density  
  (e.g. customer segmentation, document clustering).

- **Density Estimation**: modeling the underlying probability distribution of the data  
  (e.g. anomaly detection).

- **Community Detection**: groups graph nodes together into communities based on their connectivity 

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: reducing the number of features while preserving important
  information  
  (e.g. visualization, noise reduction, feature extraction).

## Overview of Included Algorithms
Some widely used unsupervised learning algorithms include:
- K-Means Clustering
- DBSCAN
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Community Detection
