# Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on labeled data—each
input example x is paired with a target output y. The goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to
outputs that generalizes well to new, unseen data.

Given a dataset of pairs
(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xn, yn),
the model learns parameters that minimize a loss function measuring how different the model’s
predictions are from the true labels.

Supervised learning problems are usually divided into two main types:

- Regression: the target y is continuous (e.g. predicting house prices or temperature).
- Classification: the target y is discrete (e.g. recognizing digits from 0–9).

Common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression,
k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. These methods
power many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, medical diagnosis,
fraud detection, and image recognition.
