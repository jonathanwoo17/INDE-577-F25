# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory contains interactive Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate and visualize
the functionality of the algorithms implemented in the `src/rice_ml` package.  
Each notebook is designed to show both how the algorithm is implemented and why
it works from a mathematical and conceptual standpoint.

---

## Purpose

These notebooks serve as an educational sandbox for:

- Testing and visualizing algorithms from the `src/` package  
- Exploring mathematical intuition behind classic ML models  
- Demonstrating small-scale experiments and result interpretation  
- Building a bridge between *theory*, *implementation*, and *practice*

---

## Structure

Algorithms are separated into two types, structured learning and unstructured learning. 
More information about the two types of algorithms and the individual algorithms themselves 
can be found in the respective subdirectories.
